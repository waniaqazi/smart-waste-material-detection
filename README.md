Smart Waste Material Detection
AI-powered system to classify waste into correct recycling categories.

A smart and clean solution that uses Deep Learning + Flask Web App to identify waste materials such as Plastic, Metal, Paper, Glass, Trash, Cardboard etc.
Built for automation, smart bins, eco-projects, and AI portfolio enhancement.


Highlights

Deep Learning CNN Model (TensorFlow/Keras)
Beautiful Flask Web Interface
Camera + Upload Both Supported
Fast Real-Time Predictions
Clean UI with modern design 
6-class garbage classification
Training graph included


📝 Project Description

This project automatically identifies the type of waste material using an AI model trained on a garbage classification dataset.
The model analyzes an uploaded image (or live camera capture), processes it, and returns the predicted waste category.
